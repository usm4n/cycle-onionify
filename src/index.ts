/**
 * Given a Cycle.js component that expects an onion state *source* and will
 * output onion reducer *sink*, this function sets up the state management
 * mechanics to accumulate state over time and provide the state source. It
 * returns a Cycle.js component which wraps the component given as input.
 * Essentially, it hooks up the onion sink with the onion source as a cycle.
 *
 * Optionally, you can pass a custom name for the onion channel. By default,
 * the name is 'onion' in sources and sinks, but you can change that to be
 * whatever string you wish.
 *
 * @param {Function} main a function that takes `sources` as input and outputs
 * `sinks`.
 * @param {String} name an optional string for the custom name given to the
 * onion channel. By default, it is 'onion'.
 * @return {Function} a component that wraps the main function given as input,
 * adding state accumulation logic to it.
